This HTML code represents a two-page PDF layout for a church bulletin, structured in a two-column design per page with various content blocks for worship order, schedules, finances, notices, and church information. Issues with PDF generation could arise depending on the library, rendering strategy, or missing styles/scripts.

Key Structural Analysis
The main container is a hidden div (.pdf-layout) intended solely for PDF export, not on-screen display.

Page Structure: Each page is a .pdf-page div. Inside, .pdf-two-column splits left/right content.

Styling & Rendering: The presentation relies heavily on custom class names (e.g., .pdf-header, .pdf-worship-item, .pdf-schedule-section) for layout, alignment, and possibly for column formatting. Correct PDF rendering assumes corresponding CSS for print/PDF media.

Common PDF Generation Pitfalls
CSS Issues: PDF generators like Puppeteer, jsPDF, or wkhtmltopdf may not interpret all CSS features equally—especially flexbox, grid, or web fonts. Ensure all layout styles (.pdf-two-column, etc.) are compatible with your PDF tool.

Hidden Elements: If .pdf-layout is hidden by default (e.g., display:none), your generator script must explicitly render this div (or clone/show it temporarily) before capturing the PDF.

Images/Fonts: If any referenced images, icons, or fonts aren’t accessible at render time, they may not appear in the PDF.

Script Execution: If any content relies on DOM manipulation via script.js, check if your PDF generator runs JavaScript before capturing—some tools (like Puppeteer) support this, others do not or require extra config.

Table Rendering: The complex table in the finance section may lose formatting if CSS isn’t carefully controlled.

Suggestions for Troubleshooting
Check CSS for Print Compatibility: Make sure all class selectors used in .pdf-layout have proper CSS and work with your PDF engine’s HTML/CSS parser.

Ensure Visibility: Temporarily set .pdf-layout to visible in the DOM right before the PDF render step.

Test Standalone Rendering: Open just this HTML/CSS in a browser. Print to PDF using browser print, "Save as PDF"—if it looks correct there, the issue is likely with the tool config.

Isolate Errors: If a specific section is missing or malformed, comment out blocks or render one piece at a time to find the problematic markup or style.

Run Script: If script.js creates or modifies any part of the PDF content, ensure the changes happen before PDF snapshot is taken.

Example Minimal Approach for Better Compatibility
Use only simple, widely-supported layout styles (float, inline-block).

Wrap each column/page content in containers explicitly sized with px or percentages.

Execute and wait for all JavaScript-driven DOM changes before snapshot for PDF conversion.

If you share the exact symptoms (e.g., elements missing, layout broken, Korean font issues), more targeted advice can be given for your specific PDF generator/toolchain.
